Handmade Lite is an educational Visual Studio framework, written by Karsten Vermeulen, designed to assist with educating other fellow programmers, programming students, and anyone else wishing to learn about game development, C++, and object-oriented programming. This project is not open source and therefore has no license affiliated with it. Please be respectful and do not distribute the engine or its code as your work. You may alter or tweak the engine code as a learning experience and you may also 'borrow' code and functionality and use it to create your own game engine. Finally, please do use Handmade Lite to develop a game.                                                                                      
                                                                                            
<b> Designed to teach. Made from scratch. Built by hand. </b>
